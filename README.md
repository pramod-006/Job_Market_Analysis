# 💼 Job Market Analysis System

A complete beginner-friendly project that analyzes job listings to extract insights, trends, and emerging skills using data analysis, visualizations, and NLP. Ideal for career explorers, job seekers, and data science learners.

## 📌 Features

- 🧹 **Data Analysis**: Clean, preprocess, and explore job market data.
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Understand hiring trends with beautiful and interactive charts.
- 🧠 **Skill Trend Detector**: Automatically extract technical skills from job descriptions and classify them as `emerging` or `established`.
- 🚀 **Deployment**: Deployable app for interactive exploration.

## 🔍 How it Works

### 1. Data Analysis
- Cleans and explores job listing dataset
- Handles missing values (e.g., "Not applicable" in `seniority_level`)
- Detects patterns such as most in-demand locations, companies, or roles

### 2. Data Visualization
- Bar plots, word clouds, time series, and heatmaps
- Interactive visuals for exploring job trends

### 3. Skill Trend Detector
- Extracts skills from job descriptions using NLP
- Calculates frequency and context-based scores
- Labels skills as:
  - `Emerging` → Rare or new-age technologies (e.g., "LangChain", "Rust")
  - `Established` → Common industry standards (e.g., "Python", "SQL")

### 4. Deployment
- Final model and visualizations integrated into a web interface
- Input new job descriptions and get predicted skill trends
